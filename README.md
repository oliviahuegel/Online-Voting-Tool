How to use the State of Florida Online Voting System 
Read all prompts before entering input into the console.
1. Enter your first name, last name, birth month, birth day, birth year, and Social Security Number. If your Social Security Number is invalid (not 9 digits), you will not be eligible to vote in the election and the program will close.
If your Social Security Number is valid, you will be able to vote in the election.
2. Next, select your county from the list of counties displayed on the screen.
The program will confirm your county and display information pertaining to the voting process and order of items to be voted on.
3. Read through the information and select which category of candidates you would like to vote for first (President, Senator, or City, Council representative).
4. Continue selecting and voting for candidates until the list of Candidates is empty. When the list of candidates is empty, the program will let you know that you have completed voting for the Candidates and Roles section of the ballot.
5. The program will now display the amendments to be voted for on the ballot. Input a “y” or a “n” to vote yes or no for each amendment.
Once you have voted on the amendments on the ballot, the program will let you know that you have completed voting in the election. The program will then display your name, date of birth, and a summary of your votes. It will total the number of “yeses” or “no’s” based on your votes on the Amendments on the ballot. This will either be 1 yes, 1 no, 2 yeses, or 2 no’s.
The program will end.
